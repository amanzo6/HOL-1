    <p>Hello my name is Anthony, I have much experience trouble shooting aeronautical components and have spent years with working on test bench equipment in the military as a avionics maintenance tech.</p>
        <p>I wanted to learn the software side of things so I am now majoring in software development going into my second year, I want to be a software engineer.</p>
    <p>I like to go to the gym and have built a computer a few years ago and am planning to upgrade it pretty soon with a new graphics card, CPU and more RAM.</p>
